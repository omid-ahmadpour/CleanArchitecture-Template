# CleanArchitecture-Template
Welcome to the **CleanArchitecture-Template** repository, a powerful solution template that exemplifies the principles of [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and incorporates the robustness of CQRS implementation using ASP.NET Core.

## Show Your Appreciation! ‚≠ê
If you find value in this project, whether you're using it for learning or kickstarting your solution, a star is a wonderful way to express your support. Thank you in advance!

# Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 8.0 Runtime

# Effortless Project Creation
Here's the simplest way to get started with your project:

1. Open your command-line interface.
2. Execute the following command:
   ```shell
   dotnet new install ASPNETCleanTemplate.nuspec::3.5.2
   ```
3. Create an empty folder to house your solution and navigate into it.
4. Run the subsequent command, replacing `MyNewCleanTemplate` with your desired project name:
   ```shell
   dotnet new aspnetcleantemplate -n MyNewCleanTemplate
   ```

# Smooth Database Migration:
To handle database migration with finesse:

1. Set the default project to **Persistence**.
2. Open the Package Manager Console and run:
   ```shell
   Update-Database -Context AppDbContext
   ```

# Monitor Health
For health check administration, utilize the following URL:
[https://Url:Port/healthchecks-ui](https://Url:Port/healthchecks-ui)
